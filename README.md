# 🧠 Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository documents my **personal learning process in Machine Learning** — from understanding fundamental concepts to coding algorithms from scratch and experimenting with libraries like Scikit-learn.

It’s not a project showcase, but a reflection of my growth and understanding as I learn ML step by step.
